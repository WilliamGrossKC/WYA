### Pin Bug

Aug 22 - Notes
- Notes: Currently I have having issues with the pin bug. The pins do not seem to be in the exact location I need them to be. This is potentially related to the incorrect sizing of the image on the results page verses the pin page. There is another error related to this bug. The pins appear to go slightly left when selected on the simulator. I am not sure if this is related to the simulator or if it is indeed and issue with the application. Potential cause could be the generation of the pin shape character naturally goes top left. Could be some other greater bug though. 
- Steps for Solution
    1. Correctly resize image. This is already something I need to do.
    2. Track pin location via console logs, ensure correct location points (I suspect this is not the problem)
    3.
